# Installation

You can load the leu library from a CDN or install it via npm.

## npm installation

For most projects, you will want to install the library via npm.

```bash
npm i @statistikzh/leu
```

## CDN

If you are in you're just using plain HTML and JavaScript without any build or transformation steps or just want to tinker around with the library, you can use a CDN.
Browsers can't resolve bare module imports without import maps. But we can use a CDN like esm.sh to resolve the imports for us.
This is also applicable in an environment like [Observable](https://observablehq.com).

If you're using this approach, **always** define the version you want to use. This way you can ensure that your application doesn't break when a new version is released.

> ⚠️ Be aware that most CDN (including esm.sh) are probably not GDPR compliant. Don't use this approach in a production environment.
