# Contributing

Contributing to this project is highly appreciated. We are happy to receive feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Web compenents

Leu is entirely built with the lit library and custom elements.
If you haven't worked with either of them before, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) has a good introduction to custom elements.
The [lit documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/) is a good starting point to get to know the library.

## Create a new component

To create a starting point for a new component, run

```bash
./scripts/generate-component/generate.js
```

Running it with `--help` will show you all available options.

It creates a basic structure for a new component in the `src/components` directory.

## Linting and formatting

This project uses eslint and prettier to lint and format the code.
commitlint is also used the enforce conventional commit messages.

To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run format
```

## Testing with Web Test Runner

To execute a single test run:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Demoing with Storybook

To run a local instance of Storybook for your component, run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Development guidelines

A few rules are necessary when developing a component library. The following conventions and guidelines should be followed when new features are implemented.

At the same time they're not set in stone. If the there is a good reason to change them open a pull request.

### Naming

Every element or custom property that will be globally available has to be prefixed with `leu`.

```js
/* Custom elements */
class LeuRadio extends LeuElement {
  ...
}

window.customElements.define("leu-input", LeuInput)
```

```css
/* CSS custom property of the theme */
:root {
  --leu-color-black-0: #000;
}
```

### Scoped styles

All CSS declarations have to live inside a custom element. This way we ensure that the styles won't interfere with the environment they're loaded into.
Styles that are shared between components should be defined as global custom properties inside the `styles/theme.css`.
When a global custom property is used inside a component it could be a good practice to assign them to a local custom property with a semantic naming.
This only make a sense when the component has a certain complexity and the global custom property are used multiple times.

```css
:host {
  --radio-color-disabled: var(--leu-color-black-20);
}
```

### Value property

All custom elements that contain a value of some sort (like an input or select fields) have to implement a `value` property.
Everytime the value of the `value` property changes a `input` event has to be dispatched.
This behaviour matches the way [Observable](https://observablehq.com) handles and observes changes of values that are contained in arbitrary elements. We decided to take over this pattern as it is usable in every other environment too.

### Custom events

Name of custom events have to be prefixed with `leu:`.

```js
this.dispatchEvent(new Event("leu:select", { bubbles: true, composed: true }))
```

### Dependencies

We try to use as little non-dev dependencies as possible. The following dependencies are used:

- `lit` is used to build all components.
- `@floating-ui/dom` is used to position tooltips etc.

### Composability

Components should be composable. This means that it should be possible to use them in combination with other components without any problems.
It can also make sense to split a component into multiple smaller components.

The `leu-dropdown` element is a good example for this.

```html
<leu-dropdown label="Download">
  <leu-menu>
    <leu-menu-item>PDF</leu-menu-item>
    <leu-menu-item>CSV</leu-menu-item>
    <leu-menu-item>Excel</leu-menu-item>
  </leu-menu>
</leu-dropdown>
```

It could've been built as a single element by passing data to a property. The component could then render the menu and the menu items itself inside the shadow dom.

```js
html`<leu-dropdown
  label="Download"
  .items=${["PDF", "CSV", "Excel"]}
></leu-dropdown>`
```

But this approach would make it impossible to create and populate the element with only HTML. It also is much harder√ü to apply event listeners or custom attributes like `role` to specific child elements.

The `leu-table` element is (currently) built like that and shouldn't be used as an example for composability.
