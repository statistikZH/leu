# Message

A message component that can be used to display feedback, alerts, or important information to the user.

[Meldungen | Design System | zh.ch](https://www.zh.ch/de/webangebote-entwickeln-und-gestalten/inhalt/designsystem/komponenten/meldungen.zhweb-noredirect.zhweb-cache.html?node-id=18369%3A164719&node-id=18369%3A163396&node-id=18369%3A166594&search=meldung) <br />

## Background

The message can appear with a colored background or with a white background. The appearance depends on the `type` attribute:

`success` and `warning` will have a colored background.

<Canvas of={MessageStories.Success} />
<Canvas of={MessageStories.Error} />

While `error` and `info` will have a white background.

<Canvas of={MessageStories.Warning} />
<Canvas of={MessageStories.Info} />

## Content

The text content can simply be passed into the default slot. The optional title of the message has to be marked up with a `<strong>` tag.

```html
<leu-message>
  <strong>Title of the message</strong><br />
  This is the content of the message. It can span multiple lines.
</leu-message>
```

## Size

The message component can be rendered in two sizes: `small` and `large`.
The `small` size does not allow for a call to action button and a title.

## Call to action button

A call to action button can added to the message by using the `cta` slot. This is only allowed for the `large` size.
Be aware that you have to set the `inverted` attribute on the button if you use it on a colored background.
The component does not handle any events of the button.

## Remove button

With setting the `removable` attribute, a close button will be displayed in the top right corner of the message.
The component does not remove itself from the DOM, but it will dispatch a `leu:remove` event when the close button is clicked.

## Popup / Toast

If you use the message as a toast or lay it over other content, you can set the `popup` attribute.
This will add box shadow to the message.

<Canvas of={MessageStories.Popup} />

## Custom accent colored

While `success`, `warning`, and `error` have a predefined accent color, you can set a custom accent color for the `info` type.
Just set the `--leu-message-accent-color` css custom property on the message element.

<Canvas of={MessageStories.CustomColor} />

## Accessibility

We have decided to not use the `role="alert"` or the
`aria-live` attribute as the message component can be used in various contexts.
We simply can't predict which role or which `aria-live` value would make sense.
Please ensure that you add the appropriate role or attribute yourself.
